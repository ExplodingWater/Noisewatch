            Tirana is a city full of life, energy, and movement,
            but this vibrancy is often hidden behind an invisible problem: noise.
            Heavy traffic, construction, and loud music <br>from local venues
            create acoustic pollution that affects not only our ears
            but also our health and peace of mind.
            Here begins the change—a new platform where
            every citizen <br>can get informed, contribute,
            and better understand the impact of noise in everyday life.

        <h3>____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</h3>
        <p>
            We are a group of professionals, activists, and engaged citizens who believe that every voice matters—and every noise has an impact.<br>
            Bloomberg is created as a modern platform that brings technology and civic awareness together in pursuit of a common goal: a quieter, healthier, and more livable city.<br> 
            Our inspiration comes from the daily reality of Tirana—a city in continuous development, but also facing the challenge of acoustic pollution that is often neglected.<br> 
            Our team works to provide reliable data, inform the public, and encourage active community participation in identifying and solving urban noise problems.

        Our platform gives everyone the opportunity to participate in monitoring noise in Tirana.<br>
        Through the interactive map, you can see the noise level in every area of the city:<br>

        🟩 Green - quiet areas, ideal for rest or walking<br>
        🟨 Yellow - moderate noise, tolerable<br>
        🟧 Orange - high noise that requires caution<br>
        🟥 Red - very high noise harmful to health<br>

        By clicking on a location, data such as the time of measurement, noise source, intensity in decibels, and resident's reports are displayed.<br>
        Anyone can add a new report. The more listens we have, the more accurate our map becomes.

    Quietness is not a privilege, it is a human right.<br>
